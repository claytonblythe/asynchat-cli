## asynchat-cli 

asynchat-cli is an asyncrhonous command line chatroom, using asyncio in python. The code was almost entirely taken from Robert Smallshire's talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM) on asyncio with Python 3. It is still in it's experimental stages, but I plan on serving up a chat room on my raspberry pi 3 in my apartment where potentially thousands of clients can connect and join the chat! 

I still plan on adding more things and customizing it a bit, so consider this the alpha version as of 11/11/17.

You should be able to connect to the chatroom with 

```telnet 68.40.128.255 2052```
